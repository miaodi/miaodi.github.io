I am a PhD student in the Department of Civil Engineering at the Brigham Young University, working with Professor [Michael Borden](https://ceen.et.byu.edu/content/michael-j-borden).

### Interests

I work in computational mechanics. The tool I am using is the [Isogeometric Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis), which is a novel computational approach that takes the finite element method to the next level. My research topics covers numerical locking problem, accoustic wave propagation problem, and high regularity multi-patch coupling problem.
